### DELIVERABLES

#### Final Presentation
**Requirements:**

  * Show off your work to what would be a less technical, more business oriented audience
  * Summarize the work you've completed from earlier deliverables into a clean presentation, including:
    * Your project's background, problem and hypothesis
    * Descriptions of the datasets you used
    * Data exploration with summary and charts
    * An explanation of your model (for non-technical audiences)
    * Recommendations based on your findings
    * An appendix that includes all of your work and technical terminology
  * Review next steps with your audience; what could you do beyond the scope of this course?

**Detailed Breakdown:**
A 10 to 20 slide deck consisting of:

 * *1 Outline Slide*
   - What is your project about?
   - What is its history?
   - What relevant information is required for a colleague to jump in to understand your project?
 * *2-3 Summary Slides* (including data and problem statement)
   - What were you trying to accomplish?
   - What steps did your project take?
   - Where did the data come from? What does a sample look like? Was there data you considered but decided to remove?
 * *3-4 Modeling Insight Slides*
   - What is the visualization explaining?
   - What do the x and y axes mean?
   - How does the visualization help either prove or disprove your work?
   - What caveats have to be explained to best understand it?
   
 
 
 * *2-3 Modeling Approach Slides*
   - What was your model trying to optimize for? Why was it the right metric for optimization?
   - What algorithm did you try? How does it work?  
 * *2-3 Results Slides*
   - What worked? What didn't? Why?
   
   -The biggest challenge was realizing that I was predicting the wrong variable. Originally I was predicting the Percent Change. Do not attempt to predict a percent change....Predict the actualy future value! R-squared jumped for .022 to 86%
 * *1-2 Conclusion Slides*
   - What had the most impact on your work?
   - What can you confirm? What can you suggest? What is still to be determined?
 * *1-2 Next Steps Slides*
   - What should this project do moving forward?
   - What would be the next two or three things you want to try? What impact might they have?
   - What might your conclusions enable others to do?

**Bonus:**

  * An Acknowledgements Slide is always a good idea :)
  * You might also include a Citations Slide, if necessary

**Submission:**	

  - Final format and submission location are TBD by instructor.
